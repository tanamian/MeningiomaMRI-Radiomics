Background: Postoperative progressive cerebral edema and hemorrhage (PPCEH) are major
complications after meningioma resection, yet their preoperative predictive studies are limited. The
aim is to develop and validate a multiparametric MRI machine learning model to predict PPCEH after
meningioma resection.
Methods: This retrospective study included 148 patients with meningioma. A stratified three-fold
cross-validation was used to split the dataset into training and validation sets. Radiomics features
from the tumor enhancement (TE) and peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) regions were extracted from
T1WI, T2WI, and ADC maps. Support vector machine constructed different radiomics models, and
logistic regression explored clinical risk factors. Prediction models, integrating clinical and radiomics
eatures, were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), visualized in a nomogram.
